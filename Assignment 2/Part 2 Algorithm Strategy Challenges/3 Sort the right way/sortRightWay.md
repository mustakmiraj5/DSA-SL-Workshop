# Problem 3: Sort the Right Way

I have to sort small batches of inventory. Around 50 items. and they are nearly sorted. 

For this kind of requirement and this kind of nearly sorted small dataset insertion sort is the best option. Because the data is nearly sorted that means there are some small displacement. so it will perform minimum shifts.
In case of bubble sort it will iterate unnecessary passes.
Selection sort does n^2 comparisons for whatever the input state is.
