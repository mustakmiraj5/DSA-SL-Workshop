# Problem 2: Searching in Product Catalog

I have a sorted product catalog which have similar products. But I do not know whether they are uniformly distributed or not. I can not use interpolation search if the data is not uniformly distributed. So the best option in current situatuin is binary search. Time complexity: O(log n).
