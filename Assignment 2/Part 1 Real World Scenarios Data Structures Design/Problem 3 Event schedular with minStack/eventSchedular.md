# Problem 3: Event Scheduler with MinStack
Requirements:
1. Designing a system where tasks are inserted sequentially.
2. Retrieve the highest priority (lowest number) task instantly.

We need 2 stack to solve the problem. The taskStack will store the tasks added and the minStack keep tracks of the highest priority(lowest number).
